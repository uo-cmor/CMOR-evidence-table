<p>There are many treatment options available for the management of knee osteoarthritis.<br>
<br>
Some of them are highly effective, reducing pain and improving joint function and overall quality of life; others have limited or unclear effect on pain or disability. Some are widely available, easily accessible, and affordable for all people with osteoarthritis; others are expensive or involve long travel or waiting times to receive treatment. Some are very safe, with few or no side-effects and little risk of harm; others may have potentially severe complications.<br>
<br>
Understanding how osteoarthritis healthcare consumers, providers, policy makers, and other stakeholders trade off between these different attributes of treatments is crucial to ensure good value, effective, accessible, acceptable, and equitable care can be made available to all people with osteoarthritis.</p>

<div class="quarto-layout-cell" style="flex-basis: 50.0%;justify-content: center;">
<p>This application presents the results of a study designed to elicit from key stakeholders the attributes of treatment considered important in choosing or recommending treatment for osteoarthritis, and their preference weights for these attributes (i.e.&nbsp;the relative importance of each attribute); to describe the performance of osteoarthritis treatments against the attributes, informed by high-quality clinical practice guidelines and systematic reviews of peer-reviewed research; and to prioritise interventions by assessing their performance relative to stakeholder or individual preferences.<br>
<br>
In this interactive application you can filter the interventions to be included in the analysis, alter the preference weights used to evaluate trade-offs between attributes, or select evidence specific to early-, mid-, or late-stage disease using the drop-down options menus, and switch between viewing the preference ranking plot and the underlying evidence table.</p>
